Built a video hosting website, overseeing every step from the initial idea to the actual build. This involved planning, designing, and making the website functional.

The website I created allows users to do a variety of things. They can upload videos, and once uploaded, these videos are displayed in a user-friendly manner. Users can interact with the videos by leaving comments, liking or disliking them, and even editing their own videos. To facilitate user communication, I added a messaging feature.

In terms of coding, I used object-oriented programming to make sure the different parts of the website worked well together. Additionally, I incorporated FFmpeg into the system. This tool is responsible for converting videos into a common and widely supported format, which is mp4.

I wanted to make the website more engaging, so I introduced a live video feature using WebRTC technology. This feature allows users to enjoy videos in real time, adding a dynamic and interactive element to the platform.

In summary, the video hosting website I designed and developed is not just about functionality; it's about creating an interactive and enjoyable space for users to engage with videos.
